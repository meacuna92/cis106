# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

## Important concepts:
* **Operating System:** The basic software that runs on a computer, enabling other software and managing hardware.
* **Kernel:** The core part of an operating system, managing system resources and hardware.
* **Components of an operating system:** Kernel, system libraries, utilities, and application software.
* **Linux :** A free, open-source operating system based on Unix, known for its stability and security.
* **Linux Characteristics:** Secure, stable, free, open-source, supports multitasking and multiple users.
* **GNU Toolchain:** A collection of software development tools from the GNU Project.
* **Linux Distribution:** A version of Linux with the kernel and other software for a complete system.
* **What is Ubuntu:** A user-friendly Linux distribution with pre-installed software, based on Debian.
* **Ubuntu Release cycles:** New versions every six months, with LTS versions every two years, supported for five years.
* **What is Debian:** A stable and reliable Linux distribution, serving as the basis for many others, including Ubuntu.
* **Different software licensing models (open source vs closed source):** Open source allows users to modify and share the software freely, while closed source restricts these actions.
* **The 4 Freedoms of Free Software:** The freedom to run, study, redistribute, and modify the software.
* **Virtualization:** Creating virtual versions of hardware, storage, and networks.
* **Hypervisor and types:** Software for running virtual machines. Type 1 runs directly on hardware, Type 2 runs on a host operating system.
* **VirtualBox:** A free, open-source Type 2 hypervisor for running multiple operating systems on a single host.
